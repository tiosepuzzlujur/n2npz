Sofiszn began her online journey in 2017, initially creating cosplay and gaming-related content. Her content gradually evolved, becoming increasingly sexually suggestive. She gained initial attention through Twitch streams and Instagram posts featuring provocative imagery and suggestive commentary. Sofiszn's music is characterized by her soaring vocals, introspective lyrics, and eclectic blend of pop, rock, and electronic elements. Her songs often explore themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, with a focus on storytelling and emotional authenticity. Sofiszn's influences range from classic rock and pop to electronic and indie music, and she has cited artists such as Radiohead, Björk, and St. Vincent as key inspirations.
